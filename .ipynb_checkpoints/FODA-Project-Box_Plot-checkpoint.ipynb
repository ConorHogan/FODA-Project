    "The boxplot was first created by John Turkey, an American Mathemtician and brother in law of one the key players in our previous project; Frank Anscombe. He introduced in his book *\"Explaratory Data Analysis\"* published in 1977.\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Among Tukey's most far-reaching contributions was his development of techniques for \"robust analysis,\" an approach to statistics that guards against wrong answers in situations where a randomly chosen sample of data happens to poorly represent the rest of the data set. Tukey also pioneered approaches to exploratory data analysis, developing graphing and plotting methods that are fixtures of introductory statistics texts, and authored many publications on time series analysis and other aspects of digital signal processing that have become central to modern engineering and science.\"* - Obituary of John Tukey - Princeton https://pr.princeton.edu/news/00/q3/0727-tukey.htm\n",
